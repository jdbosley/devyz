Mobile/Responsive Development Helper

The most basic usage of this jQuery plugin is to just download the .js file from here or include it from http://www.jonathanbosley.com/devyz/devyz.js. It must be included after including the jQuery library.

Once included this script will collect all HTML within the body tags of your website and wrap them with in a container which it can then manipulate to emulate various device sizes.

I have only included some standard device sizes that I develop with often, but you may always edit, add to, or remove from the $devyzes which populates device properties.

The idea of this project was a low-impact and easily installed script to ease responsive and mobile website testing during the development cycle.

Please send me any feedback or thoughts on this project as I plan to add improvements and possibly a device list builder via online form inputs.

This plugin includes the libraries jQuery BBQ and jQuery hashchange event by the great "Cowboy" Ben Alman.
